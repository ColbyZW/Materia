# Materia Widget Dependencies

This package is intended for use by [Materia](https://github.com/ucfopen/Materia), an open-source platform for interactive educational games and tools developed by the University of Central Florida.

With Materia 10.0 and the conversion from AngularJS to React, the **Materia-Server-Client-Assets** repo is deprecated, but the Materia Widget Development Kit still requires access to certain CSS and JS assets from the main repo. This package contains those assets.

## TODOS:

- Include JS and CSS assets required to render the Materia player and creator in the MWDK.
- Update the MWDK to Webpack 5 and add support for new JS and CSS assets provided in this package.
